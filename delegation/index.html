    <h2>Event Delegation</h2>
    <!--Insted of attaching a click eventListener to each <li> individually, 
        we attach the eventListener to the parent-element <ul>. When a click 
        event occurs on any <li>, the event bubbles up to the <ul> and can
        check the event.target property to determine which <li> was clicked. 
            
        By using event delegation, we can simplyfy eventHandling, especially in cases
        where we have a large number of dynamically created or changing elements. It 
        will improve the performance since we have fewer eventListeners attached to the DOM

        <ul id="parentList">
            <li>Item one</li>
            <li>Item two</li>
            <li>Item three</li>
            <li>Item four</li>
            <div>Item five</div>
